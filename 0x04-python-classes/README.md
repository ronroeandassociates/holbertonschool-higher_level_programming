##### PERSONAL LOG

stardate 99360.3 just received the call that my daughter is being admitted to the hospital to bring my Grandson out into the world.
append.personal.log stardate 99361.45
Been on pins and needles waiting to hear; the tragedy of the pandemic has made it impossible for the Grandparents to be at the hospital with their daughter so it has been a bit of stresser for us. Many typos were made in the making of this project most would normally been caught before being uploaded to git hopefully when I update the personal log it will be with the news of a grandchild's picture
